## We are currently using the "experimental" route as the main landing page (animated-landing-page.tsx)

## Help needed with 3 things:
1. Making the landing page design look professional (e.g., should we change the background color, how should we position the background video, how do we ensure all the text is correctly aligned)
2. Building the form (see case-assessment-form.tsx) & ensuring I can modify that as needed
3. Adding tags for Google Analytics/MixFlow (we need to see where people dropped off while completing the form)

## Additional items:
We'd like to make the form ai-enabled - there should be a message box at the bottom where we use AI to dynamically write responses & run API queries in response to particular inquiries. [Maybe we use the Vercel AI SDK?]

We need a database set up that I can easily access and work with (ideally in Python) [Maybe we use Supabase?] That database should store all the responses from the form

Please let me know of all other landing page best practices (e.g., SEO optimization, favicon, etc.) so we can create a compelling experience.

We will later want to add a couple additional pages (e.g., a blog page).

I am also open to all resources, learning, etc. that you would suggest

Thanks,
Vinay
